# Space Allocation System

## 📌 Overview

The **Space Allocation System** automates shelf space allocation based on **historical sales data, product demand, and customer preferences**. This project aims to optimize retail shelf arrangements using data-driven insights.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository consists of two main folders:

### 1️⃣ Frontend  
- Built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- Implements a **prototype** of the system's user interface.  
- Basic backend functionality for **file uploads** (stores files on the server).  
- Current working features:
  - **Dark mode toggle**  
  - **File upload functionality**  
- **Note:** Other frontend features (like prediction generation) are not functional yet.

### 2️⃣ Backend  
- Developed in **Python**.  
- Handles **allocation predictions** based on historical data.  
- Implements data processing and analysis for optimized space allocation.

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- **Integration of frontend and backend** before the next round of the hackathon.  
- Enable real-time prediction generation via the UI.  
- Improve data visualization for better insights.  

## 📌 How to Run (Current State)
